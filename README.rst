Description
===========
Genomedata is a format for efficient storage of multiple tracks of
numeric data anchored to a genome. The format allows fast random
access to hundreds of gigabytes of data, while retaining a small disk
space footprint. We have also developed utilities to load data into
this format.

Specifically, the genomedata package provides access to genome-scale data, using an
HDF5_ container.
